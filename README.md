Today, when someone is looking for various providers of maintenance services such as cleaning services or a plumber or air-conditioning servicing, they have 2 alternatives to go about this.

The first of which is to ask friends and families for any recommendations. The second is to scour through the yellow pages or Facebook groups and forums to look for any providers. The problem with the first option is the lack of choice. You just have to trust that the providers your friends and families engage with are reliable and charge a fair price. The problem with the latter is that even though you may often be able to find more choices, it is difficult for a user to judge which is good and which is bad due to the lack of other customer’s feedback. It is also time-consuming to have to individually call each of these providers to enquire about their pricing and availability. Also, you are sure that everyone uses these services from time to time, so why isn’t there an easier way to go about this?

# About HelpLah
We have created an android app using Android Studio that serves as a centralised platform that allows providers of maintenance services in Singapore to advertise their services and for customers to view them. Our app also contains a hiring system where customers can send a job request to a provider for a job on a certain date and time. We also provide a chat functionality for customers to talk to businesses and a review system for customers to leave their feedback for other potential customers to view.
